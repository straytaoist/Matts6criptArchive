## DESCRIPTION

In the distant past, perl5 was Usefulm and Used. But the world needed more, and
Larry announced the next generation, perl6. Time passed, and so did many
opportunities. Other upstarts came (and went, that was how long we waited in
the wilderness), and slowly perl5 started to fade.

And it was too late for a saviour to arrive, the world had moved on. But we
could save it, and make perl6 the go-to of choice for everything. But we needed
a killer app, something to bring people to the new temple.

Thinking back, there was, at the toddler stage of the internet, something which
elevated perl5 upwards to the heights, something which supported the internet
through the early years, nurturing and strenghtening.

perl6 needed something the same, a killer app of its own.

Why try and invent something new, why not bring to bear the might of what aided
perl5? Why not give perl6 the same set of tools, the same killers apps?

I give you this.
